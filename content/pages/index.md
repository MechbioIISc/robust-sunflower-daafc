    title: About us
    content: >
      We are a team of multidisciplinary researchers interested in understanding
      biological systems using tools from applied cell-biology, bioengineering

      and soft matter physics. Primarily, we study mechanics and biology of
      epithelial tissues in the context of cancer.

      - title: Working at the interface of biology and physics
        content: >
          We use experimental techniques such as gene editing, high resolution
          live cell imaging, traction force microscopy and reflection
          interference contrast microscopy, in tandem with concepts from soft
          matter physics to obtain a Bio-physical understanding of various
          epithelial functions. To make sense of our experiments, we complement
          them with computational tools such as automated cell segmentation and
          cell tracking.
