        subtitle: Epithelial Defense Against Cancer
        content: >
          In pathological situations, cancer is a mass of over-proliferating
          cells growing in the space of our host epithelial tissues. In
          Epithelia, elimination of oncogenic cells via cell competition is a
          defence mechanism against cancer- Epithelial defence against cancer
          (EDAC). How is EDAC impaired and how do cancer cells gain the
          competitive advantage over host epithelial tissues? Can we generate
          novel anticancer therapies which enhances our body’s defence mechanism
          against cancer?

          Aging is considered as a pro-tumorigenic state and constitutes the
          single most important risk factor for cancer development. The
          causative relation between ageing and cancer is majorly considered to
          be the accumulation of oncogenic mutations over long period of time.
          However, an alternative, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is
          possible i.e. aging influence the overall tissue mechanics and
          subsequently impair our tissue’s defence mechanism against cancer.

      - title: Heterogeneity and epithelial function
        subtitle: The restlessness
        content: >
          Recent technological and computational advances have allowed us to
          describe behaviour of epithelia using mesoscale physical principles.
          In such description, similar to glassy solids or dense particulate
          matter, epithelial cells are shown to display characteristics of
          dynamic heterogeneity. In addition to this physical heterogeneity,
          epithelial cell biology reveals an intrinsic cellular heterogeneity
          arising from variations in gene expression pattern. Physical and
          biological heterogeneity is likely to be interactive and
          interdependent. But How? How do they crosstalk to regulate tissue
          function such as wound healing and epithelial defence against cancer?
