          Trained as a Bioengineer, I am interested in studying biosystems in a
          multidisciplinary framework. In the lab, we combine tools of applied
          cell biology with concepts of soft matter physics and computational
          tools to unravel interesting phenomena in biological systems. Outside
          lab, I enjoy playing badminton and taking long walks in the woods. If
          you are interested in joining us, or looking for a collaboration, or
          just want to have a chat about research, please get in touch.

          Hi, I completed an Intl MSc(Hons) in Biological Sciences from
          BITS-Pilani (2017-2021) and have joined the EMBRG as a PhD student in
          August 2021. My research interest lies in cell biology broadly, and I
          will be working on Epithelial Defense Against Cancer. I also enjoy
          running, chess, poetry and reading.

          Hey!


          I joined the EMBRG in Jan 2022, after completing my master’s in
          biotechnology from St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata. I am passionate
          about oncology and shall be exploring how ageing influences epithelial
          defence against cancer (EDAC). My decision to join this lab as a Ph.D
          student stems from my career goal of becoming an independent
          investigator in the field of translational cancer research. Outside
          lab, I enjoy swimming, dancing and reading.
